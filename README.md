# Welcome to Zr-MOFs Database!
You can find a diverse set of guest-free and disorder-free of Zr-MOFs containing no less than 10 coordinated Zr6O8 inner cores, which have been optimized by using periodic density functional theory (DFT) combined with molecular mechanics method for more than 182 experimentally synthesized Zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs). These structures are given in the cif format.
