# Welcome to Zr-MOFs Database!
You can find more than 182 experimentally synthesized guest-free and disorder-free Zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs), which contain no less than 10 coordinated Zr6O8 inner cores. These structures are optimized by a combination of periodic density functional theory (DFT) and molecular mechanics method, and are given in cif format.
